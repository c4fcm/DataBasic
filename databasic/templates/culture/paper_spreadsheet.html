Remind the participants that data are systematic observations of the world, and a dataset is the collection of those observations. Data are a helpful reduction of the world, but it’s important to keep in mind that they do not capture everything. Data can capture different types of information (quantitative, qualitative, temporal, geographic, etc.), and the type of the data affects the kinds of exploration and pattern seeking that you can do. Data often needs to be cleaned and standardized. Data storytelling and analysis involves looking for patterns, making comparisons, finding outliers, and then testing that knowledge in dialogue with others. Finally, the way data are collected and used can raise questions of privacy, consent, and ethics, which must be taken into account when analyzing and presenting them") }}.</p>
