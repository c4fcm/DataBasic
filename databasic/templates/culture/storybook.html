Data stories built on top of a strong narrative arc are more compelling and more memorable. Participants spend time poking at an actual dataset to find a simple story, then sketch their story and play with different ways of telling it in a fun, visual storybook form. This process creates a cohesive narrative that can tell their stories in a convincing way. The “dry” information is transformed into a simple children's book-style of story.  It also reinforces the link between data presentation and storytelling. If you can't tell your data story in this simple form, there's no way you'll be able to help your audiences understand something more complicated.") }}</p>
