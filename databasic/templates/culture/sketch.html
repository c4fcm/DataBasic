It introduces basic terminology for quantitative text analysis, helps you get acquainted with Databasic.io's WordCounter tool, and prompts you to consider places in your organization where you work with text as data.  Participants will pair up with colleagues to search for stories in some fun sample data and then draw a sketch to share that story. Start the activity by playing the kickoff video below for your group.") }}</p>
